    <h1>Excessively Large Title of Email for Peter and Warren</h1>
    <p>I have a hard time understanding myself. I get hit by random
    waves of depression and I don&#146;t know what brings them
    on. What I do know is that when they hit me, sending an email
    feels impossible (even though the feeling is wrong &mdash; it is in
    fact possible to write an email). I&rsquo;m sharing these
    &ldquo;downer&rdquo; factoids with you guys because I love and
    miss you both, but I do a terrible job of expressing
    it. (Hopefully) I think I&rsquo;ve finally figured out the method that I
    need to use in order to actually keep a text-based conversation
    going with you guys.</p>
    <p>Was that too emotional? Well you&rsquo;re both just going to
    have to deal with it.</p>
